# Ant-Colony-Optimization-ACO-for-the-Traveling-Salesman-Problem-TSP-

The Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) is a nature-inspired heuristic algorithm that helps solve combinatorial optimization problems. The algorithm is based on how real ants look for food. They use pheromone trails to find the shortest paths between their colony and food sources. The algorithm has been applied to solve the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP), which is a well-known NP-hard problem. A salesman must visit a set of cities exactly once and then return to the starting point while minimizing the total distance traveled.

### Code's Features:
- Shows how the best tours and the strength of the pheromone trail change over time.  
- The number of ants, the rate at which pheromones evaporate, the number of iterations, and other settings can be changed.
